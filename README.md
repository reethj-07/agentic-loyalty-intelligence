# Agentic Loyalty Intelligence POC

An explainable, agent-based decision intelligence layer built on top of Antavo-style loyalty data.

This project demonstrates how enterprises (banks, supermarkets, fuel companies) can:
- Diagnose customer disengagement
- Explain root causes using behavior + sentiment
- Recommend next-best loyalty actions
- Escalate to humans when needed

The system uses a deterministic, sequential multi-agent architecture designed for enterprise auditability and scalability.
